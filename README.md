# STAT545 Homework 4 Repository
## Eric Sanders

Welcome! This is a repository used to store the contents of Homework Assignment 4 of *STAT545*, a course taught in the fall of 2018 at the University of British Columbia.

This repository is only contributed to by Eric Sanders, me. The main contribution to this repository besides this ReadMe is an exploration of some data rehaping and data joining prompts using the `gapminder` dataset. This work is visible **[here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-ericjsanders/blob/master/hw04Exploration.md)**!

## What is Shown in this Assignment

In this document you will see the following sections of the data exploration:

* Computing summaries of life expectancy for all combinations of year and continent in the `gapminder` dataset.
* Creating a second data set using `gapminder` as well as information published by google **[here](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv)** and downloaded as a CSV from **[here](https://github.com/albertyw/avenews/blob/master/old/data/average-latitude-longitude-countries.csv)**.
